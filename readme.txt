MS Symptoms Log (MSSL)

Current Implementation

The MSSL software is designed to help users record multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms in a personal diary and have those records organized and printed.

A typical user of the system is a person suffering from MS and/or his/her designated caretaker.

The MSSL enables the user to record MS symptoms, edit or delete previous records, view, and search records and print a document of selected symptoms for personal use.
 
On the backend, the MSSL is maintained and updated by the systems administrator.

The MSSL software operates on client/server architecture. It can run on any system with Apache web server and MySQL database. The website functionality is implemented by using the following programming and scripting languages: PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, AJAX and JavaScript. 

The user inputs consist of: 
•	login information (password and username)
•	registration (first name, last name and e-mail address)
•	symptoms log form input fields
•	search form input fields

The functionality of the MSSL website consists of: 
•	authentication and authorization
•	storage and retrieval of database records  
•	search by date range
•	print of selected records

The MSSL output consists of: 
•	error messages
•	symptoms history and search web pages
•	data entry and/or data modification confirmations
•	printable document of search results

Future Development and migration to mobile platforms

Since many people suffering from MS may have advanced symptoms or permanent disabilities, the website should offer voice activation and touch screen capabilities.
 
The popularity of mobile devices should be addressed with Responsive Web Design (RWD). 

Standalone Adroid and iPhone app needs to be considered as well.
